                <li>2 to 3 medium very ripe bananas,

                <li>1/3 cup (76g) butter, unsalted or salted, melted</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                <li>1 pinch salt</li>
                <li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
                <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Steps:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C), 
                    and butter an 8 x 4-inch loaf pan.</li>
                <li>In a mixing bowl, mash the ripe bananas 
                    with a fork until completely smooth. 
                    Stir the melted butter into the mashed 
                    bananas.</li>
                <li>Mix in the baking soda and salt. 
                    Stir in the sugar, beaten egg, 
                    and vanilla extract. Mix in the flour.</li>
                <li>Pour the batter into your prepared loaf pan.
                    Bake for 55 to 65 minutes at 350°F (175°C), 
                    or until a toothpick or wooden skewer inserted 
                    into the center comes out clean.
                </li>
                <li>Remove from oven and let cool in the pan for 
                    a few minutes. Then remove the banana bread 
                    from the pan and let cool completely before 
                    serving. Slice and serve.</li>
